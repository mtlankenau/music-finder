## Background
For our coding bootcamp's first group project, we were tasked with creating a fully functional front-end application, utilizing data fetched from two APIs.  Using the iTunes Search API and the Ticketmaster Discovery API, we created our Music Finder application!

## Functionality
* When the user searches for a music artist, they are presented with either album cards, upcoming concert cards, or a combination of both types of cards for the searched music artist, depending on which search criteria button (albums or concerts) has been selected. 
* When the user views a particular album card, they are presented with the album cover art, album title, and a hyperlink to stream the album directly through Apple Music.
* When the user clicks on that particular album card, they are presented with additional data pertaining to that album, specifically the artist name, music genre, release date, number of tracks, and copyright info.
* When the user views a particular concert card, they are presented with the artist's picture, venue name, and a hyperlink to buy tickets for that particular concert.
* When the user clicks on that particular concert card, they are presented with additional data pertaining to that concert, specifically the artist name, event date, ticket availability, and venue address.
* When the user clicks on the favorite button for a particular album or venue card, the selected card is saved to local storage.
* When the user clicks on the "Saved Albums" button, they are presented with album cards for all of the album cards that they had favorited.
* When the user clicks on the "Saved Concerts" button, they are presented with concert cards for all of the concert cards that they had favorited.
* When the user changes the viewport width of the application, they notice that the application has a fluid responsive design.
